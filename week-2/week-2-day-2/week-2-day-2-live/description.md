# Classes

In JavaScript, classes are a way to define blueprints for creating objects (these objects are different from the objects defined in the last section).

## Key Concepts

# Class Declaration:

You declare a class using the class keyword.
Inside a class, you define properties (variables) and methods (functions) that will belong to the objects created from this class.

# Constructor:

A special method inside the class that is called when you create an instance (an object) of the class.
Itâ€™s used to initialize the properties of the object.

# Methods:

Functions that are defined inside the class and can be used by all instances of the class.

# Inheritance:

Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing you to create a new class based on an existing one.

# Static Methods:

Methods that belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class. You call them directly on the class.

# Getters and Setters:

Special methods that allow you to define how properties are accessed and modified.
